# emacs-lsp-scheme

Emacs LSP client for the Scheme programming language. This is a work in progress.

This plugin is meant to be used in combination with an LSP server. Check https://gitlab.com/rgherdt/scheme-lsp-server for an LSP server I'm developing together with this software.

More instructions on how installing and using this software will follow.
